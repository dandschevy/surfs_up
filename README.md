# Module 9 - Surfs Up

## Overview
The purpose of the Surfs Up Module 9 Challenge was to retrieve data related to the temperatures on Oahu for the months of June and December, display the data in a dataframe, provide a statistical summary of the data, and provide a write up to discuss the analysis of the results.  

In order to accomplish the assignment, the following steps were completed:

  2.  Create a list from the data
  3.  Create a dataframe of the data
  4.  Provide a statistical summary analysis of the temperature data  

## Results
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables.  Use images where needed

## Summary
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December
