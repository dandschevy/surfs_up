# Module 9 - Surfs Up

## Overview
The purpose of the Surfs Up Module 9 Challenge was to retrieve data related to the temperatures on Oahu for the months of June and December, display the data in a dataframe, provide a statistical summary of the data, and create a write-up to discuss the analysis of the results.  

In order to accomplish the assignment, the following steps were completed:
  1.  Filter several years of data for June and December temperatures
  2.  Create a list from the data
  3.  Create a dataframe of the data
  4.  Provide a statistical summary analysis of the temperature data  

## Results
Below are the observations and analysis of the June and December temperature data:
  1. The total number of data elements was greater for June than December (1,700 data points in June and 1,517 data points for December)
  2. The December minimum temperature was colder than the June minimum temperature
  3. The difference between the minimum temperatures, December of 56 degrees and June of 64 degrees, was 8 degrees
  4. The difference between the maximum temperatures, December of 83 degrees and June of 85 degrees, was only 2 degrees
  5. The difference between the mean temperatures, December of 71 degrees and June of 75 degrees, was 4 degrees
  6. The standard deviation of December's temperatures was greater than that of June (3.75 and 3.26, respectively)

## Summary
According to the limited analysis of the temperature data, one could conclude that June is a more temperate month.  This can be observed by analyzing the statistical data such as the max, min, and standard deviation.  However, Hawaii has quite a bit of humidity and precipitation.  The recommendation is to further analyze the humidity and level of precipitation during June and December as well.
